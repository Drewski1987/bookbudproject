# Block 30 - Book Buddy

## Introduction

We are working with a new client who is wanting to design an online library for the public. Another Full Stack Solutions team has already built out the API, but we need your assistance in developing the front end to ensure on-time delivery to the client. When this is complete, please submit the link to the deployed application so I can share it with the client.

Details on the API can be found ðŸ”— [here](https://fsa-book-buddy-b6e748d1380d.herokuapp.com/docs/)

      <p>Complete the React components needed to allow users to browse a library catalog, check out books, review their account, and return books that they've finished reading.</p>

      <p>You may need to use the `token` in this top-level component in other components that need to know if a user has logged in or not.</p>

      <p>Don't forget to set up React Router to navigate between the different views of your single page application!</p>
